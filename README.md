# LaravelHelloWorld

This is a basic Laravel App that can be used to test the run time environment.

The only file that has been changed is the "welcome.balde.php" file (located in ./resources/views/). It's also the unique view that will be "returned" for any request (you can check the default router: ./routes/web.php).
